# problem:
# Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

                path.pop()

        backtrack()
        return ans
# on a given iteration of the backtrack, we havenâ€™t yet chosen what the next number will be
# index variable is replaced by restructuring the code to not have the backtrack function receive what the next number is immediately 
# we no longer need a outer for loop because we are not locked into any first number, code chooses all possible first numbers
# time complexity: O(n * n!)
#     first layer of tree has 1 node, second has 1*2 nodes, third has 1*2*3 nodes, fourth has 1*2*3*4 nodes, etc. -> number of nodes is n!
#     each node takes n time
#         for loop takes n time, but not every iteration of the for loop creates a child
#         as you go deeper down the tree, each node has fewer and fewer children
#         you can mentally model this as all the non-leaf nodes take n time to do a for loop and all the leaf nodes take n time to serialize
# space complexity: O(n)

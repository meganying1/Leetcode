# https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/
# difficulty: easy
# topics: array, hash table

# description:
# You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:
#   nums.length == 2 * n.
#   nums contains n + 1 unique elements.
#   Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.
# Return the element that is repeated n times.
  
class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen: return num
            seen.add(num)
# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(n)
